    /// 1) Define a list of strings (e.g. _Switches) to specify the command line switches that are understood/implemented
    /// 2) In the main function or similar, call:
    ///     CmdLine.DefineCmdLine(_Switches);
    /// It is then possible to call the other methods in the API, namely
    ///     CmdLine.GetSwitchesSupplied() - returns a list of the switches that were supplied
    ///     CmdLine.SwitchSupplied(name) - returns true if the switch was supplied on the command line
    ///     CmdLine.GetSwitch(name) - returns the value associated with the switch
    ///     CmdLine.OperandCount() - returns the number of non-switch cmmand line arguments
    ///     CmdLine.GetOperand(position) - returns the value of the 1-based non-switch argument
    /// The precise algorithm depends upon the underlying implementation of this API
